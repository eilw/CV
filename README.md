## Eirik Wiig
I’m an experienced proposition designer and developer, passionate about designing and developing new products and solutions that solves real user needs. What I love about it is the problem solving: gaining understanding of the issue, generating a host of potential ways to address it, and then figuring out the best way to solve it. Previously, I’ve helped a number of global companies to innovate at (for them) record speed – going from post-it to prototype in less than 8 weeks. Now, I want to focus and be part of solving complex and diffcult, but meaningful problems. Building ideas into live products, in an environment that values the craft of software development and good laughs, while I get to learn, be stretched and improve my craft everyday.

## Skills 

#### Software/Web Development & Testing
I have built a solid foundation in development based on best practice within XP, TDD and OO. More importantly however, I have an immense appetite to continue to improve my skills. Nothing is as gratifying as finally figuring out how to solve a problem that I have been stuck with, or equally, when someone shows me how it can be done in a better way.

- I care deeply about building clean, well tested and reusable code. Testing is core as it gives the confidence to continue to build.
- Main languages: Ruby and JavaScript.

#### Proposition design
I have worked with large companies across Financial Services and Utilities to identify growth opportunities, develop propositions, build investment cases and launch profitable new ventures that respond to the needs of their target customers.

- I’m comfortable with the full range of proposition design methodology: workshop design and facilitation, customer insight (qual/quant), market and tech analysis, conceptualisation, (digital) prototyping, commercial modelling and operational requirements.
- My four last major proposition projects have all been taken to or are in build stage, of which one has been launched ([Barclaycard bPay](http://www.marketgravity.com/portfolio/barclaycard-bpay-making-everyday-payments-easy/)).
- I've led the design of several new propositions, e.g: A new SME proposition for a leading Irish bank, the next gen banking proposition for a leading UK based bank and a new personal loan business in Scandinavia.

#### Strategy and innovation consulting
I have been a consultant for over four years, completing >25 projects in global teams across countries and industries, in the intersection of technology, innovation and strategy.

- **I learn fast**: A necessity in order to quickly get up to speed with the industry, the client's context and issues, and what the best forward should be.
- **I solve problems**: Extensive experience in breaking down problems and then gathering and using data (quant/qual) to find viable solutions.
- **I lead teams and work streams**: Lots of experience with client facing projects, leading smaller teams and providing ongoing help to more junior team members.
- **I stay smiley**: Irrespective of the number of weeks on-site, long evenings, demanding clients and tough deadlines - life is to short not too still have fun, enjoy the project (the good parts) and the people I work with.
