## Eirik Wiig
I’m an experienced proposition designer and junior developer, passionate about designing, developing and launching new products and services customers love to use. I love the problem solving at its core. And nothing lets me experience flow the same way as programming. Previously, I’ve helped a number of global companies to innovate at (for them) record speed – going from post-it to proposition in less than 8 weeks. Now, I want to be the one that builds it, in an environment where I learn and get stretched at the incredible rapid rate I had during Makers Academy. Every day of the week, while still having fun.

## Skills

#### Proposition design
I have worked with large companies across Financial Services and Utilities to identify growth opportunities, develop propositions, build investment cases and launch profitable new ventures that respond to the needs of their target customers.

- I’m comfortable running through the full range of proposition design methodology: workshop design and facilitation, customer insight (qual/quant), market and tech analysis, conceptualisation, (digital) prototyping, commercial modelling and operational requirements.
- Led the design of several new propositions, e.g. a new SME proposition for a leading Irish bank, including customer insight, concept and feature development, and prototyping.  
- Developed the next gen banking proposition for a leading UK based bank, through emerging technology landscaping, customer co-creation and conceptualisation. 

#### Software/Web Development & Testing
Although I am just in the beginning of my journey, I have a strong foundation in front-end and back-end development based on best practice within XP, TDD and OO. Most importantly, I have an immense appetite to continue to improve my skills. Nothing is as gratifying as getting stuck with an issue, trying a number of ways to solve it, until the a-ha moments drop when I’m doing something else, and I finally get it to work.

- I’m passionate about and always strive for building good quality, well tested and reusable code. Testing is core as it gives the confidence to continue to build.  
- Main languages: Ruby and JavaScript
- Built apps with frameworks such as: Rails, AngularJS, Sinatra, and tested with RSpec, Capybara, Jasmine, Karma and Protractor
