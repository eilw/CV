## Eirik Wiig
I’m an experienced proposition designer and a junior developer, passionate about designing, developing and launching new products and services customers love to use. What I love is the problem solving at its core and the flow I experience when I code. Previously, I’ve helped a number of global companies to innovate at (for them) record speed – going from post-it to prototype in less than 8 weeks. Now, I want be part of building ideas into live products, in an environment that values the craft of software development and good laughs, while I get to learn, be stretched and improve my craft everyday. 

## Skills 

#### Software/Web Development & Testing
Although I am just in the beginning of my journey, I have a strong foundation based on best practice within XP, TDD and OO. Most importantly, I have an immense appetite to continue to improve my skills. Nothing is as gratifying as getting stuck with an issue, trying a number of ways to solve it, until the a-ha moments drop when I’m doing something else, and I finally get it to work.

- I love figuring out how to solve the problem, or when someone shows me how something can be done in a better way. 
- I’m passionate about and always do my best to build good quality, well tested and reusable code. Testing is core as it gives the confidence to continue to build.  
- Main languages: Ruby and JavaScript.
- Built apps with frameworks such as: Rails, AngularJS, Sinatra, and tested with RSpec, Capybara, Jasmine, Karma and Protractor. 

#### Proposition design
I have worked with large companies across Financial Services and Utilities to identify growth opportunities, develop propositions, build investment cases and launch profitable new ventures that respond to the needs of their target customers.

- I’m comfortable with the full range of proposition design methodology: workshop design and facilitation, customer insight (qual/quant), market and tech analysis, conceptualisation, (digital) prototyping, commercial modelling and operational requirements.
- My four last major proposition projects have all been taken to or are in build stage, of which one has been launched ([Barclaycard bPay](http://www.marketgravity.com/portfolio/barclaycard-bpay-making-everyday-payments-easy/)).
- I've led the design of several new propositions, e.g: A new SME proposition for a leading Irish bank, the next gen banking proposition for a leading UK based bank and a new personal loan business in Scandinavia.

#### Strategy and innovation consulting
I have been a consultant the last four years, completing >25 projects in global teams across countries and industries, in the intersection of technology, innovation and strategy. 

- **I learn fast**: A necessity in order to quickly get up to speed with how the industry works, what the client's issues are and what the best forward should be.
- **I lead teams and work streams**: Lots of experience with client facing projects, leading smaller teams and providing ongoing help to more junior team members.
- **I stay positive**: Irrespective of the number of weeks on-site, long evenings, demanding clients and tough deadlines - life is to short not too still have fun, enjoy the project (the good parts), the people I work with and stay positive.
